# Recommended configurations for J/psi and Upsilon at EIC

The example follow the formalism and fit results from Phys. Rev. D 94, 074001 (2016) and Phys. Rev. D 102, 014016 (2020). 
There are example configurations for a full head-on collision (in `00mrad`), and with a
25mrad crossing angle (in `25mrad`), for both J/psi and Upsilon production. Available
example configurations:
 - 10 GeV on 100 GeV and 18 GeV on 275 GeV
 - electron and muon decay channels

 The J/psi examples generate by default 1fb^-1/run, and the Upsilon
 examples generate 10fb^-1/run (unless modified).
